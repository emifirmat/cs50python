--------------------CALLING--------------------------
Envido should be called at the very beggining of the turn and in the first phase. After that, players should wait until next row to call it again.
The adversary can reject, accept or follow the next chain of calls: envido --> envido --> real envido --> falta envido.
If the adversary followed the chain, then the original caller has to answer.
Note: The call can start from any point of the chain. Steps can be skipped as long as they follow the chain. 
E.g.: Player 1 calls "real envido", player 2 calls "falta envido" (they can't call envido or real envido), player 1 only can accept or reject. 

--------------------ENVIDO POINTS--------------------
Each card number represents the envido points, excepted "the oldies" which give 0 envido points.
If a player has 2 cards of the same type, they sum each other and add extra 20 points. 
If a player has 3 cards of the same type, only 2 of them can be summed.
e.g.: 3 coins, 5 coins, 1 sword --> 3 + 5 + 20 = 28 points 
e.g.2: 3 sword, 10 sword, 11 sword --> 3 + 0 + 20 = 23 points
e.g.3: 4 cup, 7 coin, 12 club -->  7 points
Min possible points: 0 
Max possible points: 33

--------------------SCORE POINTS---------------------
All score points but the rejection are accumulative.
Rejection: 1 score point
Envido: 2 score points
Real envido: 3 score points
Falta envido: Loser left-to-win score points
E.g: envido + real envido accepted: 5 score points
E.g.2: envido + envido rejected: 2 score points

--------------------JUGABILITY-----------------------
The player who answered is the first to announce their points.
In order to win, the caller should announce higher points. If they have lower points and only for the purpose of not revealing their points, instead they can say "Son buenas".
If there is a tie, the first announcer is the winner.
