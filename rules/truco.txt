--------------------CALLING-------------------------
Truco can be called at any phase of the game, before playing the card.
Opposite to the envido, it should start from the beggining of the chain: truco --> retruco --> vale 4
Adversary can accept, reject or follow the chain without skipping any steps. 
The player who accepts, can follow the chain at any phase.
E.g: Player 1 calls truco at phase 1 and player 2 accepts. At phase 3 player 2 calls retruco and player 1 rejects it.
If any step of the chain is rejected, the row ends.  

--------------------TRUCO POINTS--------------------
The purpose of calling truco is to increase the score points of the main game. That is to say, there are no truco points.

--------------------SCORE POINTS--------------------
Opposite to the envido, they are not acumulative.
Rejection or not calling it in the whole row: 1 score point
Truco: 2 score points
Retruco: 3 score points
Vale 4: 4 score points
E.g: truco + retruco: 3 score points
E.g.2: truco + retruco rejected: 2 score points
